Accident Management and Detection System

Project description:
This project presents an automotive localization system using GPS and GSM-SMS services to intimate the police station, nearby hospitals and family members that an accident has occurred.
The project is a prototype of Real Time Vehicle Tracking and Accident Detection with GPS, designed to reduce fatalities due to road accidents when implemented.
A basic microcontroller, an Arduino UNO along with an accelerometer was used to identify the impact and turn off the motor, a GPS module to locate the vehicle and a GSM module to communicate the situation for immediate help.

Components used:
-ArduinoUNO
-GPSmodule-NEO6M
-GSMmodule-SIM900A
-Accelerometer-ADXL335
